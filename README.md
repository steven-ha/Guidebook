# Guidebook

This iOS application originally started off as a project for a Usability class that I was taking at Oregon State University. The goal of the class project was to perform a usability study based on an idea for a new application. My teammates and I went through the process of defining the application, specifying the use cases and holding field/lab interviews to understand how climbers (our intended audience) researched climbing areas/problems.

From there, we iterated through various paper prototypes by testing them through our audience. The culmination of the class resulted in the final prototype, which this iOS applicaiton is loosely based on. With that said, the deviation from the final prototype to this iOS application is the result of me trying to implement the application while I was learning Xcode and Swift. Not ideal, but I learned alot through the process.

Since starting this project and learning a bit more on iOS development, I have started this project over.
